# sync-score

## What this is
A 2-player Roblox teamwork-compatibility game. Pairs (friends, MVP is
friend-invite only — see state/backlog.md) run short co-op mini-challenges
and get a "Sync Score" measuring how well they coordinated.

Explicitly NOT a dating/romantic matchmaking game, ever, in any copy, UI, or
mechanic — framing is teamwork/friendship compatibility only.

## Tech stack
- **Roblox Studio** — target platform
- **Rojo**, installed via **Rokit** (`rokit add rojo-rbx/rojo`) — NOT the npm
  `rojo` package, which is unofficial/deprecated. Syncs this filesystem with
  Studio.
- **Luau** — Roblox's typed Lua dialect
- Git, private repo

`ReplicatedStorage.Remotes` (`RoundStarted`, `RoundEnded`, `RequestPairing`)
is declared directly in `default.project.json`, not created at runtime.

## Core mechanics — source of truth, don't drift without asking
- **Pairing:** friend-invite only for MVP. No stranger-matching ("Quick
  Match") until MVP is validated — intentional scope cut, not an oversight.
- **Challenge rotation (MVP = 2 rounds, not 3):**
  1. Trust round — one player "blind" (camera/vision obscured via a UI
     overlay, NOT actual Roblox blindness mechanics), the other guides
     verbally or via text. Scored on time + mistake count.
  2. Coordination round — players tethered via Roblox's built-in
     `RopeConstraint`/`RodConstraint`. Do not build custom tether physics.
- **Scoring formula** (lives in `ScoreService.luau`, constants in
  `Config.luau`, never hardcoded elsewhere):
  ```
  100 - (mistakes * MISTAKE_PENALTY) - (max(0, timeElapsed - PAR_TIME) * TIME_OVER_PENALTY)
  ```
  clamped 0–100.
- **No pay-to-win.** Score must reflect actual coordination — monetization
  is cosmetic-only (avatar items, score-card themes). Flag any feature
  request that would let purchases affect the score.

## Environmental hazards
Separate from the Trust round/scoring system — standalone obstacles, not
wired through `RoundService`'s mistake-counting system. First one:
**Boulder Cannon** (`BoulderHazardService.luau`) — three spawn point
markers (`Workspace.RockSpawn1/2/3`, must be `Anchored` — a live
`warnIfUnanchored` check catches this if forgotten) each launch a clone of
`ServerStorage.Rock` down the ramp (hardcoded world `+Z` direction — the
decorative cannon models' orientation isn't reliable, likely no
`PrimaryPart` set), one at a time from a random spawn point, on a
randomized interval. Rocks are cleaned up via a `CollectionService`-tagged
despawn zone (`Config.BOULDER_DESPAWN_TAG`, tag name `"BoulderDespawn"`)
at the bottom, with a lifetime safety net as backup.

Touching a rock does **not** kill — it applies a physical knockback
(briefly sets `Humanoid.PlatformStand = true` so physics actually carries
the impulse, since the Humanoid controller otherwise fights external
velocity) that can knock a player off the ramp into the void, where
Roblox's own fall-death handles it — no custom kill/respawn logic. This
was a deliberate change from an earlier instant-kill-on-touch version;
don't reintroduce `Humanoid.Health = 0` here without asking.

Second one: **Log Gate** (`LogGateService.luau`) — `Workspace."Log Gate"`
(`LogStructure` model containing the log/rope parts, pivoting around a
separate `GateTop` part/model). Kinematic, not physics-driven: all parts
under `LogStructure` are forced `Anchored`, and a script manually rotates
the whole model around `GateTop`'s pivot **position** every frame (the
"rotate a model around an external point" CFrame formula —
`CFrame.new(pivotPosition) * delta * CFrame.new(-pivotPosition) *
originalCFrame`), eased via `TweenService:GetValue(...)` for a natural
pendulum decelerate/pause feel. Swings symmetrically ±`HALF_SWING`
degrees (default 160°, so 320° total) around the rest position captured
at server start — wide enough to swing up high on both sides, clearing
space under the post for a player to pass through during the pause at
each extreme.

Rotation uses a **hardcoded world-space axis** (`SWING_AXIS =
Vector3.new(1,0,0)`, via `CFrame.fromAxisAngle`), not `GateTop`'s own
local orientation — every local-axis attempt (X/Y/Z relative to
`GateTop`) produced visibly wrong results, consistent with `GateTop`
being an asset-pack `Model` without `PrimaryPart` set (same class of
issue as the Boulder Cannon's `Cannon1/2/3` models). If the swing plane
is ever wrong again, try `Vector3.new(0,0,1)` before suspecting anything
else.

Third one: **Rotating Log** (`RotatingLogService.luau`) —
`Workspace.BlindObby."Rotating Log"` spins continuously around its own
center (not an external pivot) in a horizontal plane — a floor sweep, not
a pendulum. Same world-axis-over-local-axis reasoning as Log Gate
(`Vector3.new(0,1,0)`, world up, via `CFrame.fromAxisAngle`), just
accumulated every `Heartbeat` frame instead of eased between two extremes
— no pause, constant `SPIN_SPEED`.

**Shared knockback**: all three hazards knock the player back rather than
kill (briefly sets `Humanoid.PlatformStand = true` so physics actually
carries the impulse, since the Humanoid controller otherwise fights
external velocity — the Boulder Cannon's version of this was a deliberate
change from an earlier instant-kill-on-touch version, don't reintroduce
`Humanoid.Health = 0` without asking). Once a third hazard needed the same
technique it was extracted into `Knockback.luau`
(`Knockback.apply(hit, sourcePosition, force, upward, duration)`) — all
three hazard files call into it. Per-character cooldown tracking is each
hazard's own local responsibility, not shared through the module,
since different hazards shouldn't suppress each other's knockback.

## Conventions
- Server scripts: `.server.luau`; client: `.client.luau`; shared modules:
  plain `.luau`
- Use `RemoteEvent`s for client-server score/timer sync — no polling
- Prefer Roblox built-ins (`TeleportService`, `RopeConstraint`,
  `DataStoreService`) over custom-built equivalents
- Comment any function stub with what it will eventually do, even if empty
- Keep all magic numbers in `Config.luau`, never inline

## Known environment notes
- `rojo serve` must be running locally with the Rojo Studio plugin connected
  before syncing changes
- Multiplayer testing: Studio's "Test → Clients and Servers" (2 clients) for
  solo testing of the pairing flow; real playtesting needs a second human in
  a private server

## Session protocol
Per the user's global rules: read `state/session-log.md` and
`state/backlog.md` at the start of a session, confirm priority before
starting work, and write a session summary to `state/session-log.md` before
ending.
