# Session Log

## 2026-07-14
- Scaffolded the Rojo project (`rojo init`, restructured into
  `src/server` / `src/client` / `src/shared`, rokit-pinned rojo 7.7.0).
- Wrote minimal boilerplate: `main.server.luau`, `main.client.luau`,
  `PairingService.createPrivateServer` stub, `ScoreService.calculateScore`
  (formula implemented, reads constants from `Config.luau`),
  `ResultsScreen.luau` stub, `Config.luau` constants.
- Kept the pre-existing `score_sync.rbxl` (had prior Studio work), added it
  to `.gitignore` rather than committing it.
- Initialized git, made the initial commit.
- Set up project memory: `CLAUDE.md` (architecture/mechanics/conventions,
  source of truth), `state/backlog.md` (roadmap + explicit scope cuts),
  this session log.
- Confirmed MVP scope: Trust round + friend-pairing only, 2-round rotation
  (not 3), no Quick Match/leaderboards/DataStore yet.

- Planned and implemented the MVP: Trust round + friend-pairing + results
  screen (plan approved before implementation, see milestones below).
  - Shared plumbing: `Config.luau` tags/roles/timeout, `Remotes.luau`,
    `ReplicatedStorage.Remotes` (`RoundStarted`, `RoundEnded`,
    `RequestPairing`) declared in `default.project.json`.
  - `RoundService.luau` (new): role assignment, spawn teleport, server-
    authoritative mistake tracking via `CollectionService` tags
    (`TrustObstacle`/`TrustGoal`/`TrustSpawn`), timeout, scoring via
    existing `ScoreService`, fires `RoundEnded` with score breakdown.
  - Client: `BlindOverlay.luau` (new), `LobbyScreen.luau` (new, Invite
    Friend button), `ResultsScreen.luau` implemented (score + breakdown),
    `main.client.luau` wired to `RoundStarted`/`RoundEnded`.
  - `PairingService.luau` implemented: `TeleportService:ReserveServer` +
    `TeleportToPrivateServer`, native `SocialService:PromptGameInvite` for
    the actual friend invite, starts the round once 2 players are in the
    private server.
  - Added a `RunService:IsStudio()`-gated dev bypass in `RoundService` so
    2 local Studio test clients can skip real pairing — `TeleportService`
    doesn't work in local Studio multiplayer testing.
  - Updated `README.md` and `CLAUDE.md` file-structure sections to match.
- Replaced the manual Studio geometry-tagging step with a code-generated
  map: **`CourseBuilder.luau`** (new) procedurally builds a stylized
  "modern neon minigame" lobby + slalom Trust round corridor under
  `Workspace.GeneratedMap` and tags parts with the existing
  `TrustObstacle`/`TrustGoal`/`TrustSpawn` constants — idempotent (no-ops
  if `GeneratedMap` already exists), so it's safe to call on every server
  start and won't clobber manual Studio edits made afterward.
  - `main.server.luau` now calls `CourseBuilder.build()` first, before
    `PairingService`/`RoundService`.
  - `default.project.json`: removed the placeholder `rojo init`
    `Baseplate` (the generated lobby floor replaces it), added
    `ColorShift_Bottom` to `Lighting` and a declarative `Atmosphere`
    instance for the moody theme.
  - `README.md`/`CLAUDE.md` updated — the old "tag geometry by hand in
    Studio" step is gone, replaced with "press Play, it builds itself";
    documented the one-time Command Bar call
    (`require(game.ServerScriptService.CourseBuilder).build()`) for
    baking the map permanently into `score_sync.rbxl`.
  - No changes needed to `RoundService`/`ScoreService`/client code — they
    already discover geometry generically via `CollectionService`.
- **Reverted the above**: user Play-tested `CourseBuilder`'s output in
  Studio and it looked bad, deleted the generated map, and is hand-building
  the lobby + level in Studio's editor instead. Undid the procedural
  approach:
  - Removed `CourseBuilder.build()` from `main.server.luau` (it's
    idempotent, so leaving it wired in would have silently regenerated
    the same unwanted map on the next Play now that `GeneratedMap` is
    gone).
  - Deleted `src/server/CourseBuilder.luau` entirely (user's choice — no
    reuse planned).
  - Reverted `default.project.json` back to the original `rojo init`
    `Baseplate` + plain `Lighting` (removed `ColorShift_Bottom` and
    `Atmosphere`) — the neon theming was part of the same rejected
    package, and leaving mood lighting with no matching hand-built
    geometry would look inconsistent, plus it's Rojo-managed so it'd keep
    fighting any manual Lighting tweaks made in Studio.
  - `README.md`/`CLAUDE.md` reverted to the manual Tag Editor
    instructions (`TrustObstacle`/`TrustGoal`/`TrustSpawn`).
  - **Decision for future sessions**: level geometry is hand-built in
    Studio going forward, not code-generated. Don't re-suggest procedural
    map generation without asking first.
- **Not yet done**: no level exists yet (user is about to hand-build it in
  Studio). Once it's built and tagged, next session should Play-test the
  full Trust round loop (2-client dev bypass: blind overlay, mistake
  counting, goal detection, results screen) before checking off the MVP
  item in `state/backlog.md`.

Next: user hand-builds the lobby + Trust round level in Studio, tags it,
then playtest the full loop (2-client local test) and fix whatever
breaks.

- User hand-built a lobby and a "Log Gate" structure, and a "Boulder
  Cannon" hazard (`Workspace.BoulderRamp` with `Cannon1`/`Cannon2`/
  `Cannon3` + a `Rock` template). Various small Studio-side asset
  questions along the way (wood color, rope texture tiling, asset pack
  storage via `ServerStorage`, MeshPart `TextureID` vs `Decal`/`Texture`,
  free-cam navigation) — no code changes from those, pure Studio guidance.
- Implemented the Boulder Cannon hazard (plan approved first — this is a
  new mechanic, not covered by the MVP plan):
  - `Config.luau`: added `BOULDER_DESPAWN_TAG = "BoulderDespawn"`.
  - `BoulderHazardService.luau` (new): each of the 3 cannons fires on its
    own independently staggered/randomized timer, cloning the `Rock`
    template, launching it via `AssemblyLinearVelocity` along the
    cannon's `LookVector`, letting ramp geometry + gravity carry it down.
    Kills any player character it touches (`Humanoid.Health = 0` — first
    real "kill" mechanic in the codebase, previously only
    `RoundService`'s mistake-counting existed). Despawns via the
    `BoulderDespawn` tag on a part the user places at the ramp's bottom,
    plus a ~20s lifetime safety net. Rock template is reparented to
    `ServerStorage` so it isn't itself a live hazard sitting in
    `Workspace`.
  - `main.server.luau`: requires `BoulderHazardService` **last** (after
    `PairingService`/`RoundService`) — it does a blocking `WaitForChild`
    on `Workspace.BoulderRamp` at require-time, so ordering it last means
    a missing/renamed ramp can't block the core Trust round system from
    initializing.
  - `README.md`/`CLAUDE.md` updated — new "Environmental hazards" section
    in `CLAUDE.md` documents this as the pattern for future kill-on-touch
    hazards (explicitly: don't wire hazard kills through `RoundService`'s
    mistake system, they're unrelated).
  - Manual step still needed from user: tag one part at the ramp's bottom
    `BoulderDespawn`.
- **Not yet done**: none of this (Trust round geometry+tags, or the
  Boulder Cannon hazard) has been Play-tested yet.

Next: user tags the boulder despawn part, then Play-test everything built
so far — Trust round loop AND the Boulder Cannon hazard — and report back
what breaks.

- User reported cannons not shooting. Couldn't see Studio's Output myself,
  so hardened `BoulderHazardService.luau` defensively against the two
  likeliest causes rather than guessing blind:
  - All `WaitForChild` calls now use a 10s timeout instead of blocking
    forever if `BoulderRamp`/`Cannon1-3`/`Rock` names don't match exactly
    — warns and disables gracefully instead of silently hanging.
  - `Rock` is now handled as either a single `BasePart` or a multi-part
    `Model` (suspected root cause: if `Rock` is actually a `Model`, e.g.
    from the imported asset pack, `rock.Anchored = false` would've
    errored immediately and silently killed that cannon's firing loop
    forever after one attempt).
  - Wrapped each `fireCannon` call in `pcall` so a future failure just
    warns instead of permanently disabling a cannon.
  - Asked user to check Studio's Output window (F9) to confirm actual
    root cause rather than assume the fix is right blind.
- Got real Output from the user, confirming two separate things:
  - Rojo sync **was** the root cause of "literally nothing happening" —
    `ReplicatedStorage.Remotes` didn't exist yet (`Infinite yield... on
    'ReplicatedStorage:WaitForChild("Remotes")'`), which hangs `Remotes.luau`
    and cascades into every script that requires it. User reconnected the
    Rojo plugin and it's syncing now (`Server started` printed).
  - Real bug once sync worked: `CFrame is not a valid member of Model
    "Workspace.BoulderRamp.CannonX"` — `Cannon1`/`2`/`3` are `Model`s, not
    `Part`s (same asset-pack pattern as `Rock`, which was already handled
    defensively — the cannons themselves weren't). Fixed by using
    `cannon:GetPivot()` instead of `cannon.CFrame` everywhere in
    `fireCannon` — `GetPivot()` works uniformly on both `BasePart` and
    `Model`, unlike `.CFrame`.
  - Also flagged a separate, unrelated issue in the user's own asset-pack
    content: `Workspace.Lobby.Lobby.Text.SurfaceGui.TextLabel.PoseTexture`
    /`TextureConfiguration` throws `cannot require using asset ID (lacking
    capability LoadUnownedAsset)` — a script attempting to `require()` an
    unowned asset ID, a known backdoor pattern in sketchy free models.
    Blocked by Roblox's sandbox (didn't execute), but flagged for the user
    to inspect/remove since it's outside anything in this repo.
- **Learning for future hazard/geometry code**: don't assume Studio
  objects referenced by path are a single `Part` — this asset pack makes
  everything a `Model` (`Rock`, all three `Cannon`s). Prefer
  `:GetPivot()`/`:PivotTo()` over `.CFrame` for any object whose type
  isn't guaranteed, and handle both `BasePart` and `Model` cases whenever
  touching user-placed Studio content.
- No errors after that fix, but rocks got stuck in the cannon instead of
  launching — classic cause: they were spawning exactly at the cannon's
  own pivot, overlapping its collision geometry, so physics fought the
  velocity instead of letting it fly. Fixed by adding a spawn offset so
  rocks spawn clear of the cannon before `AssemblyLinearVelocity` is
  applied. Still stuck after that — switched both spawn offset and launch
  velocity to a hardcoded world `+Z` direction instead of trusting the
  cannon `Model`'s `GetPivot()` orientation (per user's diagnosis; likely
  cause: these asset-pack Models don't have `PrimaryPart` set, so their
  pivot doesn't reliably match how they look in Studio). **This worked**
  — rocks launch — but spawning wasn't clean off the cannon geometry.
- User's fix: dedicated invisible spawn point markers instead of deriving
  position from the cannon models at all (matches the existing
  `TrustSpawn`/`TrustGoal` marker pattern, and was my own recommendation
  once the LookVector issue showed up). Also manually moved the `Rock`
  template to `ServerStorage.Rock` directly (previously
  `BoulderHazardService` reparented it there itself from
  `BoulderRamp.Rock`).
  - Rewrote `BoulderHazardService.luau`: spawns/fires from
    `Workspace.RockSpawn1/2/3` (their own `GetPivot()`, no offset needed
    since the user places them exactly where wanted) instead of the
    `Cannon1/2/3` models. Reads `ServerStorage.Rock` directly — no more
    runtime reparenting. `Workspace.BoulderRamp` and the `Cannon1/2/3`
    lookups are gone entirely; cannon models are now purely decorative,
    unreferenced by code. Kept the hardcoded `+Z` launch direction (that
    part was already confirmed working).
  - Updated `CLAUDE.md`'s "Environmental hazards" section to match the
    new structure.
- **Still not fully confirmed**: this rewrite (spawn-point-based) hasn't
  been Play-tested yet — next session/test should confirm rocks spawn
  cleanly from the three `RockSpawn` markers and launch correctly.
- Follow-up round of small fixes from continued playtesting:
  - Rocks weren't spawning far enough in front of the `RockSpawn` markers
    — reintroduced `SPAWN_OFFSET` (5 studs along `LAUNCH_DIRECTION`),
    this time applied to the spawn markers instead of the old cannons.
  - Rocks weren't despawning at the tagged platform — same root cause as
    the earlier `Model`-vs-`Part` issues: the despawn tag was almost
    certainly applied to a parent `Model`, but `Touched` only fires with
    the specific child `Part` actually hit, so the exact-instance
    `HasTag` check missed it. Added `isDespawnZone()`, which walks up the
    ancestry checking every level instead of just the touched part.
  - Two cannons could fire close enough together that rocks overlapped —
    replaced the 3 independent per-spawn timers with one shared loop that
    cycles `RockSpawn1 → 2 → 3 → repeat`, guaranteeing only one rock is
    ever launched at a time. Side effect: each individual spawn point now
    fires roughly 3x less often than before (shares one cadence across
    all three) — flag if the pacing feels off.
  - Rocks didn't roll straight down the ramp — inherent to physics-based
    rolling on an irregular mesh shape (contact with the ramp imparts
    sideways drift/spin), not fixable via launch velocity alone. Added a
    `RunService.Heartbeat` connection per rock that zeroes any sideways
    (X-axis) velocity every frame, leaving vertical (gravity/slope) and
    forward motion untouched. Tracked in the same connection-cleanup
    table as the Touched handlers.
  - User asked for "roll slower, shoot further apart, roll straight only"
    at one point, then said nevermind before I acted on it — only the
    "roll straight" part was later explicitly re-requested and done above
    ("shoot further apart"/"roll slower" were never actually implemented,
    don't assume they were).
  - Cannons weren't killing anymore — deliberately replaced instant-kill
    (`Humanoid.Health = 0`) with physical knockback (briefly
    `Humanoid.PlatformStand = true` so physics actually carries an
    impulse, since Humanoid otherwise resists external velocity every
    frame). Rock can now knock a player off the ramp into the void
    instead of guaranteeing death on touch.
  - Fixed rocks not launching/despawning/staying together across several
    rounds: spawn markers not `Anchored` (added a loud
    `warnIfUnanchored` check — this was the actual root cause of
    "nothing spawns/rocks appear randomly"), despawn tag likely applied
    to a parent `Model` not the touched `Part` (fixed via ancestry-walk
    in `isDespawnZone`), multi-part `Rock` models not rigidly connected
    (added `WeldConstraint`s at spawn time), and firing order made
    random instead of fixed round-robin per request.

- **New hazard: Log Gate** (`Workspace."Log Gate"`, `LogStructure`
  pivoting around `GateTop`) — user reported an old hand-written Studio
  script for this had stopped working; I have no visibility into
  Workspace-local scripts (confirmed nothing about it exists in `src/`),
  so built `LogGateService.luau` fresh rather than debug-blind. User
  needs to delete/disable whatever old script was in Studio to avoid it
  fighting the new one.
  - Multiple rounds of axis/direction guessing (local X, then Z, then Y
    — all wrong) before recognizing the real pattern: `GateTop` is
    almost certainly an asset-pack `Model` without `PrimaryPart` set,
    making its local orientation unreliable — same root cause as
    `Cannon1/2/3` earlier. Fixed by rotating around a **hardcoded
    world-space axis** (`CFrame.fromAxisAngle`, not `GateTop`'s local
    axes) instead — this is now the go-to fix whenever local-axis
    rotation on a hand-placed object looks wrong.
  - Swing arc: started at a full 320° one-sided sweep (matching the
    original spec literally), user reported it looped "up over the
    post," so reduced to a small symmetric ±60° swing ("like a real
    swing" reading) — then user clarified they actually wanted the wide
    320°-total sweep back (±160° symmetric this time), specifically so
    it swings up high enough on both sides to leave a gap for the player
    to pass under during the pause. **Lesson**: the "up over the post"
    complaint was about broken rotation math (wrong axis), not the arc
    size — don't reflexively shrink an arc when the user says something
    "swings wrong," check whether it's actually a math/axis bug first.
  - Not yet confirmed working after the final wide-swing change.

- **New hazard: Rotating Log** (`Workspace.BlindObby."Rotating Log"`) —
  spins continuously around its own center in a horizontal plane (floor
  sweep, not a pendulum). Asked the user whether touching it should count
  as a Trust round mistake (given the "BlindObby" naming) or knockback
  like the other hazards — they chose knockback, so it's a standalone
  hazard like the other two, not wired into `RoundService`.
  - This was the third hazard needing the PlatformStand knockback
    technique, crossing the threshold noted when Log Gate was built —
    extracted `Knockback.luau` (single `Knockback.apply(...)` function)
    and refactored `BoulderHazardService`/`LogGateService` to use it
    instead of a third duplicated copy. Cooldown tracking stays local to
    each hazard file, not shared through the module.
  - Also removed `BoulderHazardService`'s temporary spawn-position debug
    print during this pass, since that issue was confirmed fixed several
    fixes ago and the print was marked for removal once confirmed.
  - Not yet tested.

Next: user tests Log Gate (wide swing) and Rotating Log in Studio, and
reports back what breaks. Three environmental hazards now exist
(`BoulderHazardService`, `LogGateService`, `RotatingLogService`), all
sharing `Knockback.luau`, all separate from Trust round scoring.
