# sync-score

A 2-player teamwork compatibility challenge game for Roblox. Two friends are
paired into a private server and work through a shared challenge together;
their performance (mistakes made, time taken) is combined into a single
**Sync Score** that reflects how well they played as a team.

Synced with Roblox Studio using [Rojo](https://rojo.space).

## Running the project

1. Install the pinned toolchain (Rojo) with [Rokit](https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rokit):
   ```bash
   rokit install
   ```
2. Start the Rojo server:
   ```bash
   rojo serve
   ```
3. In Roblox Studio, install the [Rojo plugin](https://rojo.space/docs/v7/getting-started/installation/#installing-the-studio-plugin), open `score_sync.rbxl`, and click **Connect** in the Rojo plugin panel to sync `src/` into the place.
4. Tag Trust round level geometry in Studio with the Tag Editor: obstacle
   parts → `TrustObstacle`, the end part → `TrustGoal`, two spawn parts →
   `TrustSpawn` (see `state/backlog.md`).
5. For local iteration without real friend-pairing: Studio → **Test → Clients and Servers** (2 clients) — a dev-only bypass auto-starts a Trust round once 2 players are present (Studio only, never runs in a published place).
